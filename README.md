# cs5800p
Compilation of programs in Casio BASIC for the Casio 5800p calculator

Notes:
* Since this language doesn't allow comments (You can use an if block that always evaluates to false and write comments inside, but in my opinion it clutters the screen) the lines starting with \# are comments and don't write them.
* The @ represents the output command.
